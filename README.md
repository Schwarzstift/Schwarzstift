Hello there,

I'm a software developer for quite some years now.
Every now and then, I have a phase where I like to do some computer science project in my free time, next to my real life.
Often these proejcts contain next to a new topic also new technologies, which I'm curios about.
Hence I don't need to tell you that the quality of these repos are probably not the best.

Nevertheless, maybe some of the repositories give you the idea to start your own project. I would love to know if any of my projects inspired anybody.
Feel free to explore and fork my projects, but don't expect anything to work or to be in an acceptable state. ;)
